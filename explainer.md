## Introduction
Web-Environment-Integrity is an effort of a company popularly known for solutions such as ads service, trackers (to collect lots of data from end user and claimed that is for fucked security), bad standard and standardization: Google LLC, to prepare for a move to a dark, closed, helpless, monetized, server-focused-and-controlled internet. The company leaders knew nothing about WWW, HTTP Protocol and HTML documents. They are just things to make dirty money for them. 

Fuck google, remove all reactionarism recommendations trashes from search engine, youtube, stop providing amp for the fucked bbc and american voices to Vietnamese user now!

All people in Vietnam hates that fucking radio. There was, but there is and will be no anti-communist organization or corporation that are really patriotic. 

All opportunist. Feel yourselves so incompetent that the US government has to continue its relationship with Vietnam.

We will win!

People will win all!
